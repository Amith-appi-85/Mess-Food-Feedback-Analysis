# üçú Hostel Mess Food Analyzer

## Project Overview

This mini-project is my very first data analysis and visualization endeavor, undertaken as a beginner to learn and apply fundamental data science skills. Its primary goal is to **analyze student feedback on hostel mess food** to identify key areas for improvement and understand overall satisfaction levels.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `mess_feedback_data.csv`. It contains feedback collected from students about their mess food experiences.

Each row in the dataset represents a single feedback entry and includes the following columns:

* **Date**: The date the feedback was submitted.
* **Day**: The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
* **Meal**: The meal type (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
* **Rating**: A numerical rating (likely on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is best).
* **Feedback**: Textual comments or remarks provided by the student.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

This project was developed using **Python** and leverages the following powerful libraries:

* **Pandas**: For efficient data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
* **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* **Seaborn**: Built on Matplotlib, used for creating more aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics.

## ‚ú® Key Analysis and Visualizations

In this project, I performed several analyses and generated visualizations to answer specific questions about the mess food feedback:

1.  **Overall Satisfaction Level**:
    * Determined the average rating across all feedback.
    * Categorized ratings into "Poor," "Average," and "Good" to understand overall sentiment distribution.

2.  **Average Ratings by Meal Type**:
    * Calculated and visualized the average rating for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.

3.  **Satisfaction Variation Across Days**:
    * Explored how average ratings differ from day to day throughout the week.
    * Identified the day with the lowest and highest average rating.

4.  **Meal Rating Comparison on Specific Days**:
    * Compared the average ratings of Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner against each other for each day of the week using grouped bar charts. This helps pinpoint specific meal-day combinations that perform well or poorly.

5.  **Feedback Submission Trends Over Time**:
    * Analyzed the `Date` column to see how many feedback entries were submitted each day, identifying patterns in engagement volume.
